# Overview Project name :Packman

In this project, I will make Packman by PyGame. It will be for the first time for me to use PyGame.
I will design the files based on their feature: characters, systems, and maps. 
Also, I would like to focus on two functions that how to make enemy track packman and how to implement variety of maps in easy way.

This is the programmings which I made
1. Player can move Packman and enemy keep tracking it
2. Display score and hopefully implement a few maps.
3. if time allows me, implement saving score history.
